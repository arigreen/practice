# 7. Reverse Integer
# Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
# Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit
# signed integer range:
# [âˆ’2^31,  2^31 âˆ’ 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the
# reversed integer overflows.

    result = 0

    while remaining != 0:
        digit = remaining % 10
        result = result * 10 + digit
        remaining //= 10

    if result >= 1 << 31:
        return 0

    if num < 0:
        result *= -1
